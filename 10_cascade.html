    this just means that the order in which the things are declared in 
    should be followed like for example
    <h1>this is the first color red</h1>
    <h1>this is the second color blue</h1>
    notice how the end result is blue and not red cuz blue was the Last
    declared thing

this is the priority list for the cascade
<div class="priority">
<h1>NOTE</h1>
<h2>this is the priority list for the cascade</h2>
    <p> id > class > element </p>
</div>
